"Statistics is the grammar of science." - Karl Pearson

Hey, there! 

I'm a math/statistics enthusiast, and I enjoy finding connections between statistics and calculus. I also code in Java. Although I'm not an extremely serious coder, I use coding more as a tool to generate statistical models. I'm also looking to learn R and Python. 

One of my projects includes VStats, which is a statistics library that contains calculations for one-variable statistics, binomial & geometric distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, linear regression, matrix operations, and more! The first version is now released and can be downloaded <a href="https://captmd-11.github.io/blog/statscalculator/" target="_blank">here</a>!
