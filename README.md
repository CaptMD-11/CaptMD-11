"Statistics is the grammar of science." - Karl Pearson

Hey, there! 

I'm a math/statistics enthusiast, and I enjoy finding connections between statistics and calculus. I also code in Java. Although I'm not an extremely serious coder, I use coding more as a tool to generate statistical models. I'm also looking to learn R and Python. 

One of my projects includes <i>VStats</i>, which is a statistics calculator that computes one-variable statistics, probabilities of binomial & geometric distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, linear regression, and more! I am currently working on the <samp>Boxplot</samp> class...
