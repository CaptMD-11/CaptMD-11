"Statistics is the grammar of science." - Karl Pearson

Hey, there! 

I'm currently working on VStats, a website that calculates probabilities of Binomial & Geometric distributions, one-variable statistics, and more! 
I also love statistics research, especially finding connections between statistics and calculus.
